<!-- Vent art doesn’t have to make sense to everyone, if it makes sense to you then that’s fine.
I forgot which day this was but I had to take a 3-hour EEG test
(which means they monitor your brain while flashing lights at you to see how it would react to certain things — in my case it’s most likely for antidepressants.)
which ended up taking 6 hours because I couldn’t fall asleep.
I was thinking and I couldn’t stop thinking.
A few months later I was introduced to Car Seat Headrest and watched one of their music videos for Nervous Young Inhumans.
For me this is one of the most cathartic music videos I’ve seen so I believe it deserves a place in my thesis output. -->
