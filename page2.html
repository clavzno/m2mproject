<!-- This was when I called the Philippine suicide hotline for the second time.
(It’s a weird experience calling someone you don’t know at an ungodly hour.
I thought it was funny that they surveyed me before I started talking.
I guess that’s why the system works — because it’s so weird.)
Don’t get me wrong, they’re nice people.
I wouldn’t not recommend calling the hotline, if you need it or want to try it out, i’ve left a link in the home page. 

I know there’s not that many changes in the imagery.
I kept it that way to show the conversation going on, and to signify that it’s a very specific moment. -->
