<!-- Hello! I've seen you've found my hidden messages.
They're mostly descriptions of the artwork and some backstory.
  
It’s weird waking up calm and collected on your birthday and being so sure that you were going to kill yourself the evening of it.
I’ve been thinking about it for a while up until this point — I was going to ingest as much poison as I can.
Or, I could overdose on the ibuprofen I've been stashing away for years.
This would be my 7th attempt, if i recall correctly. 

This felt like a good warmup comic and it just so happened to be the first entry to the entire project so I kept it simple.
Me falling off the edge of a building is how I felt that morning and was something I genuinely wanted to do at the time. -->
