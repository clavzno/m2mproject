<!-- This was about a month after I got discharged.
At this point I’ve been watched 24/7 in case I’d hurt myself.
I’ve been thinking about myself so much at this point that I felt like I was out of my body.
I didn’t know what was going to happen and I felt a growing sense of urgency that I had to leave the room.
It’s not shown in the comic though, it just shows me thinking to myself that I didn’t know who I was. 

I don’t think there’s anything special about this part but it’s simple enough to understand that I’m with another doctor and she’s trying to get to know me.
I chose the colors for the doctors because that’s what colors I associate them with.
None of them really have any specific reason as to why they’re those colors, they just give me those vibes. -->
