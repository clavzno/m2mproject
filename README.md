# m2mproject
This is a copy of the site I made for my arts and design thesis in my final year of senior high school. (Grade 12) My thesis was on vent art and the benefits of it. This website was originally hosted on https://m2mproject.neocities.org

The contents and everything is finished but I still have to fix everything in order to make this a proper github pages site.
