<!-- This comic another change in the four-panel format,
depicting a head as the front wheel of a bike with the caption “cyclothymia.” 
Cyclothymia is the diagnosis I was given by the second psychologist I saw.
After that, I was given a mood stabilizer and later on antidepressants.
The bike is representative of the cycling thoughts
I experience during episodes wherein I may be feeling very bad or very happy. -->
