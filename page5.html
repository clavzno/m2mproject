<!-- I almost forgot about this.
I was admitted the day after my birthday so the hospital staff noticed and sent me some gifts.
I got a packet from a local chicken place that had a card, some pens, and a black notebook.
They found out that I was an artist beforehand.
I don’t have the card anymore but I do remember something about living a long, happy, fruitful life.
I just thought this was funny to show because I was admitted as a kid who recently attempted to commit suicide.

I changed things a bit here.
This comic has a shift in art style, as it is supposed to function as comic relief in such a personal comic.
I include some edited stock photos of nurses that came into my room.
In a way this is to signify that I’ve forgotten what they looked like. -->
