<!-- On the first meeting with my first psychologist, I told her what I did a few hours before coming to her office.
I told her everything that was going on.
In return, she said she had to have me admitted to the hospital (not the ward, yet. I wasn’t diagnosed with anything and this is the first day)
the next day because I was suicidal and had a very high chance of hurting myself.
(which was true, to be fair)
The comic is mostly about the trip to the hospital. 

There’s been a shift in color here.
It’s to show the growing dread that I’ve been feeling during the trip and when we arrived there.
The end panel isn’t me vibrating, it’s how I decided to show that I was dissociating, rotting in the pit of my own mind.
When I made this comic, I started feeling the same dread that I did before.
I think that’s the catharsis that’s part of the process of making vent art. -->
