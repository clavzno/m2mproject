<!-- This was on the final day when my therapist asked to talk to me in private.
When she hugged me, I hugged her back.
I couldn’t cry, not after holding it in for a solid week.
It was painful but I appreciated it. I thought that was the last time I was going to see her but I continued seeing her on a monthly basis.
When I went home, I was advised to be watched 24/7 up until I saw my second psychologist.
I felt so helpless leaving that hospital, even after seeing the medical bills.
I felt like it was such a waste because I barely ate the food they gave me and I just lied in bed rotting. 

As you can see there’s some sort of clawing figure around my character.
This is to show the growing fear I had — that I had to live moving forward and that I was never going to get the help.
I was a dead man walking. I left the hospital with the same monsters in my head as when I came in. -->
