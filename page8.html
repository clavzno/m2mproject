<!-- These are thoughts that filled my head at the time and I was beginning to question everything.
I brought it up with my doctor and she said that I had a lot of ambivalence in my head.
A lot of my thoughts were going against each other.
I wanted to kill myself but I also wanted to live, I wanted to get help but I didn’t trust her.
I still struggle with these ambivalent feelings but I’ve learned to identify which thoughts were automatic
because of my depression and learned to reason with myself. 

Excerpt from my thesis: During the climax of the story, I experiment with the now redundant four-panel format.
The character is shown on the bottom right and there are jagged and swirled lines that represent the thoughts that
the character is thinking about after all that’s happened so far.
These are real thoughts that have gone through my head. -->
